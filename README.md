# Scheduler Library

## Introduction

This library is designed to distribute scheduled data propagation tasks across multiple workers using queues. It is built with Go and provides a robust and efficient solution for managing and scheduling tasks in a distributed system.

For now we have support to queues in Redis, but we are working to add more queue systems such as in-memory, Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.

## Features

- **Distributed System**: The library uses a distributed system to ensure that tasks are evenly distributed across all available workers.
- **Queue Management**: The library uses queues to manage tasks. This ensures that tasks are executed in the order they are received and that no task is lost.
- **Scalability**: The library is designed to scale with your needs. You can easily add more workers to the system to handle increased load.
- **Efficiency**:
  The library is designed with a focus on high performance and low latency. It employs advanced scheduling algorithms and efficient data structures to ensure that tasks are executed as quickly as possible. Furthermore, it minimizes resource usage, allowing for a large number of tasks to be handled simultaneously without significant memory or CPU overhead. This makes it an ideal choice for high-throughput, resource-intensive applications.

## Installation

To install the library, use the `go get` command:

```bash
go get github.com/Rfluid/scheduler
```
